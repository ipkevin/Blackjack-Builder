# Blackjack Builder (aka John Wick Blackjack)

This project was created for my capstone project for BrainStation's Software Engineering / Web Development Bootcamp in Spring 2023.

Play a stylish game of blackjack locally or online with friends in a gambling game styled after the John Wick movies!

This is WIP! Eventually, Blackjack Builder will allow anyone to easily create and deploy their own Blackjack games with minimal new development needed.

### Packages Used

React, Node, Boardgame.io, Sockets.io

### How to Use

* Clone repo
* npm -i to install dependencies
* npm run start to begin a local game (edit App.js to change number of players)
